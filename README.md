# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It was my first programming project, developed to practice and improve my coding skills. The game supports two modes:

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against another person.
- **CPU Mode**: Play against an AI opponent using the **Minimax algorithm** for optimal moves.

## Features

- 🎮 **Interactive UI** with a clean and responsive design.
- 🔄 **Two game modes**: Player vs. Player and Player vs. CPU.
- 🤖 **AI-powered opponent** using the Minimax algorithm.
- 🏆 **Dynamic game status updates** and win detection.
- 🔄 **Automatic restart** after the game ends.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** → Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS** → Styling for an engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript** → Game logic, event handling, and AI implementation.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Choose your preferred game mode (**Two-Player** or **vs. CPU**).
3. Players take turns clicking on the board to mark their symbol (**X** or **O**).
4. The game announces a **winner** or a **tie** when the board is full.
5. The game **resets automatically** after a few seconds.

## Lessons Learned

- ✅ Fundamental programming concepts (*variables, loops, conditions, and functions*).
- ✅ **DOM manipulation** and event handling in JavaScript.
- ✅ Implementing **AI logic** with the **Minimax algorithm**.
- ✅ Enhancing user experience through **styling and animations**.

## Future Improvements

- 🔥 Add **difficulty levels** for the AI opponent.
- 🎨 Improve **UI with additional animations and sound effects**.
- 📊 Implement a **scoreboard** to track wins and losses.

This project was a significant milestone in my journey as a **developer**, and I look forward to enhancing it further! 🚀
